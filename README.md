My React.js Practice Repository

ðŸŒŸ Welcome to my coding space! ðŸŒŸ

This repository contains my journey of learning and experimenting with React.js. If you're interested in exploring or collaborating, feel free to clone the project and try it yourself.

âœ¨ Getting Started

To get started, just follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone <REPO_URL>

npm start

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application in action.

ðŸš€ Available Scripts

Inside the project directory, you can run:

npm start

Runs the application in development mode. It will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

npm run build

Builds the application for production in the build folder. It optimizes the code for the best performance.

npm run eject

If you need to customize the Webpack, Babel, or other tool configurations, you can run this command. Warning: This action cannot be undone.
